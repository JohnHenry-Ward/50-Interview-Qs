### [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/submissions/)
First solution: Traverse tree, keeping track of the depth, and returning the depth once we hit null. Return the max of traversing left and right subtrees. Runtime: O(n)

### [Invert/Flip Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/invert-binary-tree/)
First solution: Invert (swap children) each subtree of root, left and right child. Recursivly do this for each child.

### [Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)
First solution: Check if current node in p and q are non none, if so, check if they are equal, if so, continue with left and right child recursivly. Runtime: O(n)
